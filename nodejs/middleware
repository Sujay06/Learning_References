MIDDLEWARE:
-----------

"USE MIDDLEWARE ONLY WHEN NEEDED, ELSE IT SLOWS THE REQUEST PROCESSING CAPACITY OF YOUR CODE!!"

>Middleware is a subset of chained functions called by the Express js routing layer before the user-defined handler is invoked. 
>Middleware functions have full access to the request and response objects and can modify either of them.


Client Req -> MIDDLEWARE -> Server Response

Built-in middlewares available in Express::
-------------------------------------------
>index.use(express.json()); 	//To parse req.body from the req.
>index.use(express.urlencoded({extended : true}));	//To add client req to the server.	
>index.use(express.static('public'));	//To add public files like css and html.

To create your own custom middleware functions::
-------------------------------------------------
>create a separate file with the required function & code , export it to the index.js file using module.exports
>write the const test = require("./<file-name>");
>write index.use(test);		//your middleware is called!!

Third-party middlwares avialble in express::
-------------------------------------------
>Head to expressjs.com -> resources -> middleware

Few handy one's are listed below:
>Morgan(npm i morgan)	//To log each http request made to the server.
>Helmet(npm i helmet)	//To secure your apps by setting various HTTP headers.
